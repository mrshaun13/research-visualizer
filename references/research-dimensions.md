# Standard Research Dimensions Framework

This framework ensures consistent, comprehensive coverage without user specification. Apply based on research lenses detected in Phase 1.

## Always Include (Universal)

| Dimension | What to Gather |
|---|---|
| Temporal trends | How has the core metric changed over the chosen time axis? |
| Demographics | Age, gender, geography, education, income of relevant populations |
| Baseline comparison | General population numbers for every metric measured in subgroups |

## Population Lens

Triggered when studying a group of people.

| Dimension | What to Gather |
|---|---|
| Population size | How many people, growth/decline over time |
| Career/lifecycle | Entry age, duration, exit age, transitions (if applicable) |
| Health outcomes | Physical and mental health conditions, mortality |
| Economic outcomes | Income, revenue, financial stability, inequality |
| Social outcomes | Relationships, family, community, stigma |

## Behavior Lens

Triggered when studying a behavior or trend.

| Dimension | What to Gather |
|---|---|
| Prevalence | How common, by group, over time |
| Taxonomy | Subcategories/types (discover via Taxonomy Discovery Protocol) |
| Frequency | How often, intensity measures |
| Outcomes | Consequences, correlations, risk factors |

## Industry Lens

Triggered when studying a market or industry.

| Dimension | What to Gather |
|---|---|
| Market size | Total revenue, number of workers, growth rate |
| Revenue distribution | By percentile, inequality metrics (Gini, top 1% share) |
| Worker conditions | Safety, regulation, career outcomes |
| Subindustry segments | Meaningful splits within the industry |

## Culture Lens

Triggered when studying cultural phenomena.

| Dimension | What to Gather |
|---|---|
| Generational attitudes | How do different cohorts view this topic? |
| Media representation | How is this portrayed in media over time? |
| Public opinion | Polling data, acceptance/stigma trends |
| Policy/legal | Regulatory changes, legal status over time |
